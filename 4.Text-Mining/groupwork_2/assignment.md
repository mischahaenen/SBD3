We are the communication department of Berner Fachhochschuleand manage various channels of which Twitter is one. Next to our own activities on this social media platform, we are interested in finding out how other Universities of Applied Sciencesuse Twitter. Any insights are of value, because such can help us to further improve our communication strategy on Twitter and beyond.

1. How many tweets are being posted by the various Universities when? Are there any “release“ strategies visible?
2. What are the tweets about and how do other Twitter users react to them (likes, etc.)?
3. How do the university tweets differ in terms of content, style, emotions, etc?
4. What specific advice can you give us as communication department of BFH based on your analysis? How can we integrate the analysis of tweets in our internal processes, can you think of any data products that would be of value for us?

Dataset: Tweets created by one of the swiss universities of applied sciences (until Jan/23)
Quantity: 19.575 tweets
File: Tweets_all.rda
Variables: ID & Id_str(of the tweet as integer and as string), full_text, in_reply_to_screen_name, retweet_count(how often a tweet was re-posted by Jan/23), favorite_count(how often a tweet was liked by Jan/23), lang (language of the tweet), university (which univ. of applied science created the tweet), Various forms the tweet‘s timestamp (e.g. created_at, tweet_date, tweet_month, tweet_minute).
Further hints: How to deal with re-tweets, automated tweets & chatbots and emojis?

Robins Plan:
Step 1: Project Initialization & Team Alignment

   metrics (likes, retweets).
   • Identify any visible patterns or strategies used by universities.
1. Content Analysis (3 hours)
   • Perform basic text mining to categorize tweets and uncover common
   themes.
   • Use sentiment analysis to gauge the emotional tone of the tweets.
   Step 5: Comparative Analysis & Insight Generation
